This file is just containing notes from Christian Jaeger, it is not

What I've observed:

I've imported the full history export for
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Chapman (the export file was named
Wikipedia-20100418160552.xml).

Running step1.pl was very fast, but step2.pl was very slow (several
minutes just for one file??, there must be something broken?).

Also, it seems the resulting history has a different order of commits
in Git than in the xml file, why would that make sense? Whereas in the
xml file the entries are ordered by the timestamp, in Git they are not
anymore in parts of the history.

Also, I wonder why step1.pl created 90 *.db files?

$ ls *db|wc -l
90
$ grep timestamp Wikipedia-20100418160552.xml |wc -l
979

So I guess something is broken.
